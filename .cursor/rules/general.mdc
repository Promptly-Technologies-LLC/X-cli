Always run Python code with `uv run`.

Write statically typed Python and run lint and type checks with `uv run ruff check --fix` and `uv run ty check`.

Practice test-driven development. Always write tests first, verify they fail for the right reasons (RED), then write the code to make them pass (GREEN), then refactor to clean up the code.
